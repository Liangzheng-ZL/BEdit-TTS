# BEDIT-TTS: TEXT-BASED SPEECH EDITING SYSTEM WITH BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMERS

### **Zheng Liang, Chenpeng Du, Kai Yu, Xie Chen**

In our paper, we proposed BEdit-TTS: Text-Based Speech Editing System with Bidirectional Transformers. We provide our speech samples and code as open source in this repository.

**Abstract :** In recent years, the text-to-speech (TTS) model has achieved great success and received widespread applications. Recorded audio plays a critical role and is irreplaceable in our daily communication in spite of the high-fidelity speech produced by TTS models. It is of practical value to manipulate the recorded audio flexibly in many scenarios such as entertainment and audio post-production. However, it is still challenging to “edit” the recorded audio based on current TTS models given the diversity and variability lied in the realistic speech. In this paper, we extend the neural TTS model by incorporating the contextual spectrum and prosody features to construct a text-based speech editing system, which is named BEdit-TTS. Our proposed BEdit-TTS allows the user to perform deletion, insertion and replacement operations on the recorded audio. The objective and subjective evaluations  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and exhibit superior performance over several competitive baseline systems.
